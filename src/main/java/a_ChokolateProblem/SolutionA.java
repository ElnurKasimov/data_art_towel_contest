//    Task A
//
//    Chocolate problem
//    Collision of titans, breaking bars, mind games - that's what awaits you in this problem.
//    There was a game table with a chocolate bar on it.
//    As always happens in such cases, Buggy and Proggy saw it at the same time and began to pull.
//    Having not identified the strongest, Buggy took a chance and proposed
//    The Chocolate Game “All or Nothing”.
//    The rules of this game are as follows: initially in the hands of the players
//    there is one piece of chocolate of size NxM.
//    The first player breaks it into two rectangular parts and leaves them on the game table.
//    After this, the second player selects one of the pieces on the table and performs
//    the same operation on it.
//    A similar procedure is repeated until there are no 1x1 pieces left on the table
//    (they cannot be broken, chocolate contains strong nuts).
//    The one who cannot perform the operation loses. All the chocolate.
//    Proggy decided to go first. Will this help him?
//
//    Input format
//    The only line contains two integer numbers N and M (1 <= N, M <= 70000).
//
//    Output format
//    Output the winner's name: "Proggy" or "Buggy".
//
//    Examples
//    Input
//      2 2
//    Output
//      Proggy
//    Input
//      1 3
//    Output
//      Buggy
