//    Task B
//
//    Guarded talisman
//    Despite his harmful behavior, Buggy is a rather vulnerable pest who also has his own favorite things.
//    Who can like it when the most important talisman turns out to be hopelessly damaged?!
//    This is what happened with Baggyâ€™s favorite piece of paper: it ended up in the teeth of Proggy,
//    who did not fail to bite off a couple of corners.
//    Buggy repaired the sheet and now it has the shape of a parallelogram.
//    But the grievances were not forgotten, and Baggy got ready to protect his talisman.
//    He patrols the area between two opposite sides, each of which is A meters long.
//    Having reached one of them, Baggy turns around and hurries along the shortest route back.
//    As you may have guessed, the length of the shortest path is B meters. And he has no rest either day or night.
//    Meanwhile, Proggy learned about what happened to the paper sheet.
//    He is interested in how much paper he can chew this time.
//    Try to do the math while Proggy comes up with a new sabotage plan.
//
//    Input format
//    The only line contains two integer numbers A and B (1 <= A, B <= 2000000000).
//
//    Output format
//    Print the area of the sheet of paper accurate to 0.001.
//
//    Examples
//    Input
//      2 4
//    Output
//      8.000
